                                key skills. This is a unique school with a focus on
                                technical skills. In computer science lessons we 
                                solved problems in C#, in labor lessons we created 
                                projects on Arduino, there were a lot of additional 
                                courses where we studied a lot of things, from 3d 
                                modeling to designing and creating electrical circuits. 
                                The most important skill I got here is the ability to 
                                learn new things quickly.</p>
